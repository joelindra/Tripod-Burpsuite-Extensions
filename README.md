# Tripod-Burpsuite-Extensions
multi-functional Burp Suite extension. It combines a versatile network listener with a powerful payload generator into a single, convenient tab within Burp Suite. This allows you to easily catch HTTP callbacks (for out-of-band testing), receive reverse shells, and generate  payloads for various targets without leaving the Burp environment.
